## (1) Noisy digits localization & classification
The goal of this project is to design and evaluate a deep neural network for (1) localizing and (2) classifying handwritten digits in images, where the digits aren't necessarily centered inside the images, and different noise types could be applied to them.

The stages of the project will be as follows:

1) Data preparation - Loading a handwritten digits dataset (the MNIST dataset) and expanding the images, such that the digits are placed randomly inside a larger image.

2) Model development - Designing and training the deep learning model, and explaining the reasoning behind the different development decisions.

3) Performance evaluation - Evaluating the performance of the model in the localization and classification tasks, especially under the application of different noise types. Then suggesting performance improvement strategies.

4) Model deployment - Planning how to deploy the model at the front-end and the back-end, and how to deal with potential congestion issues.
